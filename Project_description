Background
The general objectives of my brainhack project is to familiarise myself with machine learning techniques, develop effective way of sharing my work with a team, practice python programming and planify organization of the data for my PhD work to come.

Specific learning objectives and deliverables
During the brainhack school, I hope to achieve to following goals:

1) Starting from a fictive equation and data calculated with the equation, test machine learning tools to find the weight of parameters for the linear model.  For example :
   f(t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = 2.1*t + 3.6*u + 2.8*v + 5*w + 1.4*x - 2.5*y + 4*z
   f()=cognition
   t=systolic blood pressure/140
   u=diastolic blood pressure/90
   v=glycosylated Hb/7
   w=age/70
   x=LDL/2
   y=years of education/12
   z=VS/20
   
2) Redo with a non-linear equation.

3) Redo with introduction of variability in the model. (Precision on the mesures of parameters, errors, etc)

4) Program in python a small algorythm to read text files medical past history and medication in tables (the problem is they used lot of different words for the same disease, abrviations, etc.)

I don't know with who I want to work with but I have lot of interest in vascular impact on cognition and my final model will probably includ that parameter.
