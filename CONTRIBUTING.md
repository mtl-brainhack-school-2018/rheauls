PYTHON
I need help to debug my python code.  
I will do a JUPYTER NOTEBOOK that I can share. 
(Even I know it is not of any interest, just to practice sharing data and work.)
***KIND OF URGENT***

SciKit-learn
I will need help to adapt the code to my BrainHack project.

DOCKER
I need someone who can help me the last week to run my analysis in docker to make a container.

GitHub
I will need help to make PROPERLY a log book of my activities on GitHub, every day of the last week of the BrainHack.

LORIS
If I have time at the end of the BrainHack, I will make a small LORIS database with the data I generated with my python code.  
Pretty sure I will need help to do that.
Very lucky to be in contact with the LORIS team at the MNI that will help me if needed after the BrainHack.
