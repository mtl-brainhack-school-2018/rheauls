I'm trying to learn how to:
+ Preprocess resting-state fMRI data

using NIAK, fMRIprep (& Docker) and/or CPAC

My PhD project focuses on multimodal connectivity in development and I would like to include resting-state fMRI data along with my DWI volumes. I have never pre/processed an fMRI scan before and have some extra "fun" issues with some of my scans (orientation/distortion) that need to be resolved. My data come from different scanners and locations which might mean using a different preprocessing pipelines/parameters per scanner.

| Deliverable: Processed set of test data (20 subjects), preprocessing pipeline/script (if different from basic tools)
+ Analyse connectivity data

structural and functional connectivity using DWI + rsfMRI

Data reduction, whole-brain vs specific network connectivity, multimodal analysis, definitions of connectivity... plz help.

I know little about either functional or structural connectivity analysis and how to run my own stats on them -- why to choose certain tests over others, what the measures represent, etc -- but it's what I want to do for my PhD project! So would be nice to know at least something about it.

| Deliverable: Analysis plan + ability to explain it to my grandma
+ Batch-processing on Compute Canada

My imaging dataset has nearly 1000 subjects so I need to run a lot of jobs on CC (cedar/graham). I would like to know some of the specific parameters to use with proper batch-processing etiquette so as not to anger the Compute Canada gods.

| Deliverable: Process 20 jobs without getting a reprimanding email from CC
