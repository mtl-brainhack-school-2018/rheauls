## Background
The general objectives of this BrainHack project is to use machine learning techniques to estimate the parameters of mathematical models.

## Specific learning objectives and deliverables/n
During the BrainHack school, I hope to achieve to following goals:

1) Starting from a fictive equation and data simulated with the equation, test machine learning tools to find the weight of parameters for the linear model.  For example:

   f(t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = 2.1*t + 3.6*u + 2.8*v + 5*w + 1.4*x - 2.5*y + 4*z
   
   f()=cognition
   
   t=systolic blood pressure/140 | u=diastolic blood pressure/90 | v=glycosylated Hb/7 | w=age/70 | x=LDL/2 | y=years of education/12 | z=VS/20 |   
   
2) Redo data simulation using a non-linear equation.

3) Introduce noise to the simulated data.

4) Try automatic clustering on one model.

5) Use machine learning techniques to recover the original parameter estimates from the noisy data.
